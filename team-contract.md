# Team Contract 
The purpose of this contract is to outline standardized expectations and procedures for the working relations and group structure among team members of CS 481.
## Group Work Expectations
Group Communication Channels: All communication will be respectful to other group members. Group members will communicate via a group Slack channel. The Slack channel will be used for the following: 
- progress updates
- sharing ideas, thoughts, concerns
- requests for input or help.
Responses to questions or requests for help or input will be made within 24 hours.

Group Meetings and Participation: Team members will contribute to the best of their ability, with the goal being an even split of time and effort between group members. Group members acknowledge that strengths and abilities may vary between group members and will assist each other to facilitate learning during the class. 

Group members will attend all group meetings unless an agreement is reached prior to the meeting that a member does not need to attend or if an emergency occurs.

Group meetings will occur during class time on Thursdays (1:30-2:45) and at other times as necessary and agreed to by all group members.

Group Decision Making: Team members will discuss all major design decisions and follow the plan reached via group consensus. No major decisions will be made individually. Leadership will be shared between team members.
Division of Labor:
Group members will work as a team to define tasks and determine assignment of tasks to each group member via group consensus. 
####Group Work Review and Submittal:
The group Git repository will be set up so that a merge to Master requires review and approval of two other group members. Group members will review pull requests within 24 hours or contact the member who submitted the pull request if that deadline cannot be met. Tasks will be broken down into stories, with the work for each story on a branch from Master. No work will occur directly on the Master branch once initial set up is complete.

## Individual responsibilities
### Communication
If a member is unable to attend a group meeting, they must notify all members as soon as possible via Slack or during a previous group meeting. If a group member needs help or is blocked and unable to complete their work, the member should ask others for help at least 24 hours before the submittal deadline. 
### Respect
 Each and every team member is expected to speak to each other with respect, and respect everything in which they are contributing. No team member will be shamed or disrespected for asking for help. A violation of this, depending on the severity, could result in firing.
#### Equal Participation 
All members are expected to provide work to the best of their abilities on all assigned tasks. They are also expected to speak up at the time of assigning tasks if they feel that there is one in particular that they might be best at or might struggle with. 
#### Attendance
 A team member is expected to attend all meetings unless otherwise communicated with the rest of the members. If a member is missing more meetings than they are showing up to, they are subject to verbal warnings, grade reduction, or potential firing.
#### Decision Making 
No large decisions that will impact the group or tasks being worked on by other members will be made by a single individual without discussing them with the group first. Full consensus of the group must be reached before these decisions can be made.
## Grade reduction procedure
If a team member breaks the terms outlined in the ‘Group Work Expectations’ and ‘Individual Responsibility' sections above, they may be subject to a grade reduction. Common reasons may include not seeking or notifying groups of conflicts within 24 hours, failure to participate on a group project, or failure to contribute any meaningful work on a group project. The other group members may vote (2/3 of members in agreement) to enact this procedure, which is as follows:
- Cite the Group Work Expectations and/or Individual Responsibilities that have not been met by the offending group member
- Notify the offending group member by email as to why the other group members want to pursue a grade reduction (This meeting may be enough to cancel the full grade reduction procedure depending on the reception of this message)
- If an agreement cannot be met with the offending member, or the remaining group members deem it necessary, email Shane Panter (shanepanter@boisestate.edu) to request the grade reduction, citing the reasons outlined above.
## Firing procedure
If a team member frequently breaks the terms outlined in the ‘Group Work Expectations’ and ‘Individual Responsibility' sections above, and other group members have attempted the ‘Grade reduction procedure’ to no avail, they may be subject to firing. Common reasons include the ones outlined in the ‘Grade reduction procedure‘, but repeated as a habit by the offending team member. The other group members may vote (2/3 of members in agreement) to enact this procedure, which is as follows:
Cite the Group Work Expectations and/or Individual Responsibilities that have frequently not been met by the offending group member
Notify the offending group member through email as to why the other group members want to pursue firing (This meeting may be enough to cancel the full firing procedure depending on the reception of this message)
If an agreement cannot be met with the offending member, or the remaining group members deem it necessary, email Shane Panter (shanepanter@boisestate.edu) to request the firing, citing the reasons outlined above.
## Punishment for doing a git push –force

Serious answer: Just don’t do it. If a ‘git push -force’ results in a significant loss of progress on an assignment or the overall integrity of the group repository, other group members may vote for a grade reduction or firing of the group member in question.

Joke answer: Public shaming, exile, etc.
