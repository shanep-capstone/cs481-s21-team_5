## User Story

As an Intermountain Bird Observatory researcher, I need to be able to easily place and secure the RFID 
antenna and reader in a way that will not disturb the birds visiting it. I need the device to be heavily 
weather proofed to withstand year long placement in the open.    

## Tasks

1. Research task: Temperature constraints on the reader
	-  Determine how hot the reader will get while working
	-  Determine if there will be a need for air holes in the reader housing
	-  Document findings in user manual
2. House the reader
	-  House reader in something that meets constraints discovered in Task 1 if needed
	-  Make sure the housing is water resistant
	-  Determine how to best attach reader to housing
3. Mount the antenna
	-  Determine whether it should be mounted in or outside of the bird box
	-  Determine how to attach the antenna to the box
	-  Determine how to safely and easily direct the wire from the antenna to the reader
	-  Determine how to protect the antenna from weather
4. Mount the housing
	-  Determine the best location to mount the reader
	-  Consult with IBO, document consultation
	-  Ensure ease of installation and removal for storage when not in nesting season
	-  Attach housing as determined
5. Documentation task
	-  Document a Bill of Materials in the user manual
	-  Document complete installation instructions in user manual


### Time estimation method

The team completed our agile time estimation using the Bucket System. We used this system because it is
relatively fast to complete the first steps, it allows everyone to participate equally, and it provides
relative results rather than absolute estimates. We felt that the relative results would help us to divide
the work equally, since we thought we had a reasonable grasp of how big tasks were relative to each other,
even if we weren't sure how many hours they would take.
 
We met via Zoom and used a Google Doc to make a comprehensive list of tasks and a blank subsection for each bucket.
We used buckets 0, 1 ,2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 13, 20, 50, 100 and 200 for our time estimation, although we did not end up
with tasks in all the numbered buckets. We then discussed the first few tasks together and collaboratively agreed
which bucket they each belonged in, discussing the effort involved for each, one task at a time.

We tried to start with tasks that had a range of levels of effort to give us representative tasks to refer to
when estimating the remaining tasks. We then divided the rest of the tasks up between the three of us and we
individually assigned tasks to buckets on our own. 

We then met again via Zoom and reviewed the buckets and the tasks in each and made adjustments.

- Task 1: Bucket 1
- Task 2: Bucket 3
- Task 3: Bucket 2
- Task 4: Bucket 3
- Task 5: Bucket 4

## Definition of Done

- Task 1 DOD
	-  Enough information is known about the system heat to determine proper housing requirements
	-  Findings are properly documented in the user manual
- Task 2 DOD
	-  Device is water resistant - rain will not wet the electronics
	-  Device does not overheat in housing 
- Task 3 DOD
	-  Antenna is mounted in the best location for birds and researchers alike.
	-  (If inside mounting is determined) Antenna can pick up birds standing on the outside of the hole.
	-  Antenna is connected to the reader with proper and safe wiring. 
	-  Antenna will withstand all expected weather conditions
- Task 4 DOD
	-  Reader is mounted securely, especially so that wind will not affect it.
	-  Reader will not interfere with nesting birds or birds looking to nest.
	-  Reader is easy to remove for storage. 
	-  Entire setup is checked and approved by IBO
- Task 5 DOD
	-  Bill of Materials is documented clearly so that any researcher IBO could purchase all parts necessary to produce more systems.
	-  Build instructions are documents clearly so that any researcher at IBO can reproduce the system quickly and easily without any misunderstandings.
