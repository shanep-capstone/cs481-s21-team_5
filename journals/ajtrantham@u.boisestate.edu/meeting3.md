# Meeting 3

- Attendance: John was absent AGAIN!

Today the team and I compared our progress on the paper. Bob had some issues getting QEMU all
configured properly to run his OS so we all chipped in and helped him out. Everyone is making
really good progress! We are all feeling good about getting done, except for Johns part of course.

UPDATE: John sent an email 3 hours after the meeting was complete and said that he was cooking
peeled donuts for breakfast and one of them exploded so he was in the hospital all morning and
that is why he missed the meeting.

My task for this week:

- Start working on researching scheduling in Linux
- Merge in all my work on the process section from previous week
