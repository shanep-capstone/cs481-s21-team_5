# Meeting 2

### Attendance: All present

### Meeting Prupose:
Plan Sprint and Begin Feature Development

### Last week's Accomplishments
- Finished our story board and task breakdown
- Estimated tasks 
- Assigned tasks to sprints and individuals
- Checked in with Heidi and recieved answers to questions

### My tasks for this week:
- Aquire and install new data loggers #13
- Connect and test Data LOggers to the metro board #16
- Configure RFID chips to connect with metro board

### Lessons Learned
 - Clear gameplan works wonders
 - Working with hardware is difficult to do, it is static and hard to change when you make a mistake
 - bucket system was a nice way of estimating tasks relative to other tasks - it doesn't give a clear timeline per se
   but it is a nice eay to quickly get a feel for the tasks that will be easiest and most difficult
