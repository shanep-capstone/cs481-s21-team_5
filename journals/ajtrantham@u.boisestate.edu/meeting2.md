# Meeting 2

- Attendance: All present

Well John derailed the meeting today by spending the entire time talking about baby alpaca's.
Every time we tried to get back on task John would become irate about not respecting his time
and extensive knowledge of baby alpaca's.  John hasn't done anything on his portion of the paper
yet.

My task for this week:

- Start working on researching processes in Linux
