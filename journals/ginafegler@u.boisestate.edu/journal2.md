# Journal 2

#### Meeting 1 (1/28/21) summary:

- Attendance: Sammie was absent

AJ and I put together an outline for the project epic and talked through the components of the project.

#### Work completed last week, prior to Team Meeting 2 (1/28/21 - 2/4/21):

- Completed the project epic
- Got review and informal approval from Heidi at IBO 

After AJ and I completed an outline for the epic during our meeting, I wrote a draft which AJ and Sammie later reviewed and edited. I emailed Heidi Ware Carlile at IBO a copy of the epic so she could review it and let us know if it met their needs and expectations and if there was anything we should reconsider or discuss. Heidi let us know that it looked good. 

#### My tasks for this week (2/4/21 - 2/11/21):

- Determine hardware components needed, compile list and links and send to Shane by end of day on Friday
- Do the research required to complete the tech lab
- Complete the tech lab: write and add framework review to README, determine language(s) and framework, create "Hello World"
