# Journal 6

#### Meeting 5 (2/25/21) summary:

- Attendance: AJ, Gina - Sammie was absent

AJ and I spent the meeting working on the CI lab. We worked on setting up a workflow in Github Actions from scratch for Platformio. We get it running up to the point where it looks for the upload port to load the code on the board, at which point it fails because its not running locally on a machine with the Metro board connected. We realized we aren't sure if we can actually run all the tests via Github Actions because of the requirement to have the hardware to run the tests. We are going to work independently to see if we can either figure out a way to mock or simulate a board to run the tests or if we should just compile the code versus running tests. We may need to consult Shane Panter.

#### Work completed last week, prior to Team Meeting 6 (2/25/21 - 3/4/21):

- Completed the CI lab
- Implemented Platformio CI to build but not run tests, since that requires a board, set up the badge in the README
-coordinated w/ Heidi to get the nestboxes, Sammie picked them up



#### My tasks for this week (3/4/21 - 3/11/21):

- Complete the Planning lab
- Work on first tasks after they've been planned
