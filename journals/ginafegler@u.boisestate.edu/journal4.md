# Journal 4

#### Meeting 3 (2/11/21) summary:

- Attendance: All present (AJ, Gina, Sammie)

The team spent the meeting time looking into build systems. We did some searching online during the meeting and decided to use Platformio, which is "a cross-platform, cross-architecture, multiple framework, professional tool for embedded systems engineers and for software developers who write applications for embedded products". We did not get it up and running and figure out the build and clean scripts during the meeting and decided to keep working individually.

#### Work completed last week, prior to Team Meeting 3 (2/11/21 - 2/18/21):

- Completed the build lab
- Ordered RFID PIT tags from Eccel

I ordered the avian leg bands (with the tags) from Eccel and got them on Wednesday. I installed Platformio and completed the build lab tasks, which consisted of making our Blink program a Platformio project and completing the scripts. I also added some notes to the main README on how to build and the Path Environment variable that has to be set for it to work. I pushed the changes to a branch for the other group members to review. AJ and I met during class time on Tuesday to start on the Test lab and figure out the test framework. We found that Platformio has a test framework that uses the Unity, which is a test frameword for C (http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity) and decided to use that.


#### My tasks for this week (2/18/21 - 2/25/21):

- Complete the Test lab
- Get leg bands to other group members, get board from AJ
- Get Blink working on the board once I have it
