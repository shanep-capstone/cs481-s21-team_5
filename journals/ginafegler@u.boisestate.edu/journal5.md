# Journal 5

#### Meeting 4 (2/18/21) summary:

- Attendance: All present (AJ, Gina, Sammie)

The team spent the meeting time working on getting the Platformio test framework that uses Unity that AJ and I decided to use when we met on 2/16 during classtime. The Platformio test framework uses Unity, a test framework for C, and we were had trouble figuring out if that was something that we needed to download from github and if so, what we needed to do in order to use it. We did not get tests up and running during our meeting decided to keep working individually. We also discussed how we were going to solder the RFID reader module. AJ was going to look into it. We also planned to exchange the RFID tags and the metro boards on Friday.

#### Work completed last week, prior to Team Meeting 5 (2/18/21 - 2/25/21):

- Completed the test lab

Once I had the Metro board, I was eventually able to run some simple tests with the Platformio test framework and also execute Blink, which was our equivalent of Hello World. I completed the test script.  


#### My tasks for this week (2/25/21 - 3/4/21):

- Complete the CI lab
- Get antenna and RFID module from Sammie, who picked them up from Ben
- Start the planning lab so we can get going on the project code
- Check in with Heidi at IBO about getting three nest boxes so we can start figuring out how the atenna and reader will be mounted on the nest box.
