# Journal 1

#### Work completed prior to Team Meeting 0 (1/14-21 - 1/21/21):

- Brainstormed ideas for our project.

The team shared ideas throughout the week via a team Slack channel that we set up to use during the project. My best ideas were a habit tracking app and a smart birdfeeder using RFID. 

#### Meeting 0 (1/21/21) summary:

- Attendance: All present (AJ, Gina, Sammie)

We decided during the meeting to pursue the RFID/smart birdfeeder idea and to contact the Intermountain Bird Observatory (IBO) to see if they have a current or proposed project using RFID tracking that we might be able to contribute to with our project. 


#### Work completed last week, prior to Team Meeting 1 (1/21/21 - 1/28/21):

- Contacted IBO

I emailed IBO after our meeting and also left a voicemail on their general number. I recieved an email back from Heidi Ware Carlisle at IBO that she was interested in talking with us and we set up a Zoom meeting the following day (1/22/21). AJ and I attended the meeting with Heidi as Sammie had a family emergency and let us know before the meeting. IBO is interested in using RFID to track visits to nestboxes for blackcapped chickadees and house wrens at their Boise River site and is willing to work with us. 

AJ and I also met during classtime on Tuesday to discuss the project components and questions we need to research.

#### My tasks for this week (1/28/21 - 2/4/21):

- Research RFID tracking in ornithology and what components will be required
- Confirm with Heidi that we are moving forward
- Write the project epic in the README with the group
