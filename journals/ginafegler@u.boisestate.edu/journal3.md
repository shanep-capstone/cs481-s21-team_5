# Journal 3

#### Meeting 2 (2/4/21) summary:

- Attendance: All present (AJ, Gina, Sammie)

The team spent the meeting time researching and looking at hardware component options so that we could get a request submitted as soon as possible. After we ran over time, we decided to keep working individually and get a wishlist emailed to Shane Panter on Friday.

#### Work completed last week, prior to Team Meeting 3 (2/4/21 - 2/11/21):

- Completed the tech lab
- Selected major hardware components and submitted request to Shane Panter
- Researched avian leg bands and RFID PIT tag options
- Corresponded with Heidi @ IBO about tag options

The team spend a substantial amount of time researching hardware component options for the reader prototype in order to get a wishlist submitted. While we weren't expecting to need to make those decisions quite so fast, it was good to get it completed early in the process. I spent some additional time tracking down PIT tag options and checking w/ Heidi what size/type to get.


#### My tasks for this week (2/11/21 - 2/18/21):

- Order the avian leg bands/PIT tags
- Complete the Build lab
- Research automated build pipeline for Arduino projects
