# Meeting 1

- Attendance: John absent

John Doe skipped out on the meeting because he said it was international underwater basket weavers
day and he had to attend a mandatory safety briefing to keep his basket weaving license. According to
John, underwater basket weaving accidents are the number one cause of death for people between
the ages of 19 and 21.5 years old so if he missed the meeting it could literally kill him!!

The rest of the team and I finished selecting the operating systems that we want to research
and stubbed out all the sections on the paper

My task for this week:

- Get the Latex file all updated with our names
- Stub out my sections
