# Meeting 3 - 2/11

- Attendance: All Present

Today we worked on figuring out how to use build and clean files with Arduino. We found the Arduino CLI documentation,  
installed Arduino CLI, and need to read through it to understand everything. 

My task for this week:

- Read and understand the usage of Arduino CLI:
https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/latest/getting-started/
- Read about automated build pipelines starting at this link:
