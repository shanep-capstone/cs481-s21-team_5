# Meeting 4 - 2/18

- Attendance: All Present

Today we worked on installing and running platformio to run tests. We also discussed when to meetup to get our set of
electronics and other implementations we may need such a unity.

My task for this week:

- Pick up hardware from AJ
- Get the hardware completely set up on my computer
- Make sure tests work on my board.
