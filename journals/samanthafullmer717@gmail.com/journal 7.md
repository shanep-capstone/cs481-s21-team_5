# Meeting 7 - 3/11

- Attendance: All Present

This week we finished the planning assignment, making all of our stories and tasks. We decided to use GitHub Projects to set up
a good taskflow and milestones to keep us on track through development. 

My task for this week:

- Email Heidi our questions
- Research temperature constraints on the reader 
- Research how polling works and come up with a good polling strategy
